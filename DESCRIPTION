Description: Global Inference for Functional Data Analysis in R. This package 
    provides a C++ implementation of Hotelling's T^2 statistic generalized for 
    functional data featuring fast pseudoinverse computation using the 
    RcppArmadillo package. Other state-of-the-art statistics suitable to 
    functional data are provided as well and can often be seen as simplified 
    versions of Hotelling's statistic. The package fdahotelling also provides 
    means for making inference on the mean of a population of curves (or on the 
    mean difference between two populations of curves) in both parametric 
    fashion (relying on the normality assumption) and non-parametric fashion 
    (relying on permutation principles).
