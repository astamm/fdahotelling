Description: Inference for Functional Data Analysis in R. This package 
    provides a C++ implementation of Hotelling's T^2 statistic generalized 
    for functional data featuring fast pseudoinverse computation using the 
    RcppArmadillo package. Other state-of-the-art statistics suitable to 
    functional data are provided as well and can often be seen as 
    simplified versions of Hotelling's statistic. The package fdahotelling 
    also provides means for making inference on the mean of a population 
    of vectors of any dimension or curves (or on the mean difference 
    between two populations of vectors of any dimension or curves) in both 
    parametric fashion (relying on the normality assumption or large 
    sample approximation) and non-parametric fashion (relying on 
    permutation principles).
