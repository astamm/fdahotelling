#' Inference for Functional Data Analysis in R
#'
#' The \pkg{fdahotelling} package provides a number of statistics for functional
#' data that turn out to be useful in the context of inference for the mean of
#' populations of curves. The package has two main categories of functions:
#' statistic functions that computes the values of different statistics and
#' statistical test functions that perform statistical testing on the basis of
#' a subset of statistics.
#'
#' @section Statistics for functional data:
#' The \pkg{fdahotelling} package provides a total of 7 different statistics
#' that are Hotelling-inspired.
#'
#' @section Statistical tests for the mean of functional curves:
#' The \pkg{fdahotelling} package provides implementations of both parametric
#' and non-parametric procedures for making inference on the mean of functional
#' curves.
